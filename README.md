Next generation Solana payment with minimalist design and Solana for 
cryptocurrency payment (e.g. NFT, Bitcoin, etc).
# Installation
You must have:

- Node.js v16 or up
- yarn
- Expo Go (Android or iOS and neccesary to run with `yarn start`)

First, please install dependencies by
```
yarn
```
Then execute by either `yarn android` or `yarn ios`. But I recommend you to use `yarn start` for cross platform purposes.
The QR code will show up in your terminal and then scan it with Camera app (iOS).
